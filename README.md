Assessment Task 2: Innovation Design Sprint Prototype Presentations

ÔÅ™ Please click the section below to expand it and view the content.

Professionals need to apply innovation methods and mindsets in order to drive positive change and create impact within their organisation.

Data retention summarWe want to help yoyu learn a proven methodology or process, which you can apply in the MIG or in any career you choose.

Sprint methods are used by the most successful organisations in the world, including Google Ventures, and are now widely used across sectors. Why? The sprint process helps teams learn through doing and allows them to be uber productive in a short amount of time. Sprints have been shown to save unnecessary time, money and discussions and to boost creativity. We can all become distracted by competing demands and goals and it can be hard to focus as an individual, let alone a team.

The sprint process helps you focus and boosts productivity in three key ways:

1. It allows you to leverage both individual and group contributions simultaneously, leading to interdisciplinary creativity and a more multidimensional view of the problem and its possible solutions

2. It allows you to put aside dedicated time to prototype without distraction

3. It provides short inescapable deadlines to keep you moving and stop you from getting ‚Äúlost in the weeds‚Äù

A design sprint is a unique rapid 5-day process for answering questions and solving problems through prototyping and testing ideas with stakeholders, users and customers. It is applicable to any context and challenge. You‚Äôll develop and apply an innovation and entrepreneurial mindset.

The idea is to build and test a prototype in just a few days, rapidly progressing from analysing the problem to testing a solution using a proven step-by-step method. It allows you to fast-forward into the future a little, so you can start to see how

customers/users react before you invest further time and expense to create a new product, service, marketing campaign, or idea.

You will use this innovation process to leverage the power of an interdisciplinary team to solve a complex challenge. This will enable you to generate potential solutions to create economic, social or environmental value for your industry partner and for society.

You will nd that you can apply aspects of the sprint process and mindset in your studies and career.

We‚Äôve designed all our assessment tasks to be progressive and scaffolded.

Assessment Task 2 (AT2) will help you build your prototype.

AT2a is your rst draft. AT2b is an iteration of AT2b with enhancements.

Assessment Part Design Sprint Stage

AT2a (15%) initial verbal presentation of your challenge analysis, sketch, storyboard and prototype

AT2b (15%) verbal presentation of an iteration of the above, based upon feedback, plus some initial customer testing

AT2b will build on AT2a. The feedback from AT2a will help you with AT2b. Handy Hint: All of AT2 will help you write your nal report (AT3), which is a written version of your AT2 Innovation Design Sprint Prototype Presentations. During Weeks 2 and 3, you will cumulatively build and iterate your sprint prototype. Along the way, you‚Äôll also build skills and con dence in applying innovation.

ÔÅ¢

Using the prototype template

Our presentation template will help you complete AT2a and AT2b

Our presentation template will help you complete AT2a and AT2b.

The workshops during Weeks 2 and 3 are designed to help you create slides in your Innovation Design Sprint Presentation template. This template is your guide. Your coaches will help you work through this template during Weeks 2 and 3.

The Week 2 slides focus upon AT2a. We will focus upon building these slides during the workshops throughout Week 2.

The Week 3 slides show what you will add to AT2a to complete AT2b. In the workshops in Week 3, we will focus upon iterating your Week 2 talk. You will also add sections on customer testing and next steps.

ÔÉÄ Assessment Task 2A Overview

PART 2a: Initial challenge analysis and prototype

Value: 15%

Format: 6-minute Group Presentation

Submission: In person group presentation

Marking: See assessment guidelines and marking rubric

Late Penalty: 10% per day, or part thereof

Feedback: Written or audio feedback via Moodle

Each challenge team will create slides to present to the other challenge teams and coaches in the MIG for feedback.

The presentation is 6 minutes +/- 30 seconds.

Each challenge team should include slides covering the topics below:

The challenge as envisioned by the team, including the focus chosen for your sprint A diagram/map of the problem that considers the different stakeholders and systems related to the problem, with consideration of interdisciplinary perspectives, sustainability, empathy and human-centric design

An sketch of three ideas considered by the challenge team, and why they have decided that a certain solution is the best one at this stage

A storyboard that takes your winning sketch and extends it into a story from the customer/user perspective. The storyboard grid should include an opening scene that conveys how the customer/user rst interacts with the challenge topic, and will roll out from there ‚Äì showing how the customer/user moves through your proposed solution to a positive outcome (include just enough detail)

A ‚Äòfake it‚Äô prototype or a facade of your solution including the proposed format for the prototype (e.g. physical, design map, infographic, report, recommendations, etc.), and the key tools you needed to build this (e.g. keynote, iPad, paper report, acting, survey, research method, etc.).

These topics will be covered in the workshops throughout Week 2 (you will receive training) and are explained in more depth in the Week 2 slides in our Innovation Design Sprint Prototype Presentation template.

The template includes examples and formatting ideas (although you are welcome to use your own formatting).

New instructions will appear each day, for that day.

Clear and professional communication is a thread throughout this unit, as it allows you to in uence and drive change. At least three individuals from the challenge team must present.

Value: 15%

Format: 6-minute Group Presentation

Submission: In person group presentation

Marking: See assessment guidelines and marking rubric

Late Penalty: 10% per day, or part thereof

Each challenge team will create slides to present to industry partners (and a handful of customers/users during testing) for feedback, ahead of the development of the nal AT3 individual Industry Innovation Report (Week 4).

The presentation is 6 minutes +/- 30 seconds.

Each challenge team should include:

A challenge analysis diagram/map

A storyboard that shows the customer/user experience

Some insight draw from initial testing with at least ve users/customers and the industry partner as well as research from the literature (grey plus additional peer reviewed as desired)

Next steps you will take to develop your prototype based upon testing

Feel free to hone and iterate the presentation based upon feedback on AT2a, and your work across Weeks 2 and 3.

AT2b includes extra sections on customer testing and insights.

Requirements are explained with examples in the template here. See the Week 3 slides in the AT2 Prototype Presentation Template for the additional slides and examples on user/customer testing and next steps.
